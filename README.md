# A-Two-Branch-CNN-Architecture-for-Land-Cover-Classification-of-PAN-and-MS-Imagery
Python implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) proposed in academic paper

This repository contains functions to preprocess the panchromatic, multispectral images, and training mask polygons into the proper
format, and feed them to the CNN model for training.

The CNN used here is the one proposed in the paper 'A Two - Branch CNN Architecture for Land Cover Classification of PAN and MS Imagery'
by Gaetano R., Ienco D., Ose K., Cresson R. (2018)
